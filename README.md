# Data Analysis

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**! This repository is a collection of my data analysis projects, showcasing my skills in data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. Each project includes code, datasets, and a detailed report to present my findings and insights.

---

**Explanation:**
- Each project has its own folder, which may include:
  - `data/` → Dataset(s) used (sample or anonymized)
  - `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks with analysis and visualizations
  - `src/` → Python scripts for reproducible analysis
  - `README.md` → Short description of the project
- The root `README.md` (this file) gives an overview of all projects in the repository.
